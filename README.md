Hi!<br>
Iâ€™m @freebirdATL. ATL = Atlanta, the greatest city in the world and my home.

I'm an accountant turned data engineer ...<br>
... but there were many steps during that transition (and I'm still learning!).<br><br>
Which means, if you find yourself in the wrong career path and need to move, I'd love to share my experience .<br><br>
